# BSDotsInstaller
This is the boilerplate for my install install script

## Usage
The script takes the files found in the ./dots directory and places them into the intended locations

./dots/config -> ~/.config
./dots/fonts -> ~/.fonts
./dots/themes -> ~/.themes
./dots/icons -> ~/.icons

System Configs
./dots/system/etc -> /etc
./dots/system/themes -> /usr/share/themes
./dots/system/icons -> /usr/share/icons
